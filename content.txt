Certainly, understanding that the one-off implementations are also in Azure but do not use the Blueprints provides more context. Here's a refined methodology that takes this into account:

### Cloud Resiliency and Disaster Recovery Testing Methodology for Azure (Including One-Off Implementations)

#### 1. **Assessment Phase:**

##### a. **Identify Critical Systems & Dependencies:**
   - Include both Blueprint-based implementations and one-off custom implementations within Azure.
   - Evaluate dependencies across both types of implementations to ensure a holistic view.

#### 2. **Planning Phase:**

##### a. **Develop Test Scenarios Specific to Each Implementation:**
   - Create tailored scenarios for both standard and one-off implementations, considering their unique configurations and dependencies.

#### 3. **Development Phase:**

##### a. **Implement Test Environments:**
   - For Blueprint-based systems, leverage Azure Blueprints to create test environments.
   - For one-off implementations, manually replicate the environment, ensuring alignment with the live configuration.

#### 4. **Execution Phase:**

##### a. **Conduct Tests Across All Implementations:**
   - Execute parallel or sequential tests for both standard and one-off implementations to understand their interdependencies and interactions.
   - Validate recovery procedures within Azure, ensuring that custom configurations are accurately restored.

#### 5. **Review & Optimization Phase:**

##### a. **Analyze Test Results Across All Scenarios:**
   - Consider the interplay between Blueprint-based systems and one-off implementations, identifying potential weak links between them.
   - Collaborate with relevant teams responsible for one-off implementations to ensure optimization.

##### b. **Update & Optimize Disaster Recovery Plans:**
   - Include specific strategies for one-off implementations, ensuring that their unique configurations are appropriately addressed within disaster recovery plans.

#### 6. **Compliance & Reporting Phase:**

##### a. **Ensure Unified Compliance:**
   - Harmonize compliance efforts across both Blueprint-based and one-off implementations within Azure.

##### b. **Generate Unified Reports:**
   - Prepare reports that consider both types of implementations, providing a comprehensive view of the overall cloud resiliency and disaster recovery posture.

By incorporating these specific considerations related to one-off implementations within Azure, this refined methodology provides a more comprehensive approach to testing and ensuring cloud resiliency and disaster recovery. Collaboration between teams responsible for standard and custom implementations will be vital in achieving a cohesive and robust disaster recovery strategy.
